				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					Some of my programs are written in Visual basic 6.0 and to run them you will need to have the
					VB6 runtime files installed on your computer. To check if you have them installed please
					search your windows directory after a file named &quot;Msvbvm60.dll&quot; if you have this
					file then you proberly have the Vb6 runtime files installed and you don't have to download
					them once more. If you don't have this file on you HD then you need to download them, click
					on the link below to start downloading them now.
